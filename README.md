# pwbot2
A simple bot for Perfect World 1.5.0

This "pwbot2" is an upgrade from a previous version "pwbot", which works in a newer version of PW.

Tested at this server, which claims to be 1.5.0, shrunken down to 1.3.6: https://pwglobal.org/
Make sure to start the game in 32-bit mode.

What this bot does:
- acquires character info
- targets mobs by "TAB"
- kills mobs by "F1"
- grabs loot by "2"

TODO:
- implement all in-game interactions by code injections. This should allow doing more complex behaviour, such as killing specific mobs, complex looting, bulding navigation routes, and running the bot in background
